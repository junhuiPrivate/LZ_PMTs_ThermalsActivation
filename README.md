Being worked with a 4th year graduate student at Brown, Casey Rhyne, I model the Co-60 activation which is thermal neutron capture on Co-59 within the Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) materials resulting from exposure to neutron sources present near the PMT storage and testing area at Brown University. We firstly took the He-3 tube out from a Bonner Sphere detector as a thermal neutrons detector, then measured the flux at variant distances from each thermal neutrons source individually, we finally modeled the activation of the PMTs successfully: the activation is contributed from two neutrons sources, the Cf-252 and the deuterium deuterium generator. The modeling has been verified by a series of tests. This work has been circulated to the whole LZ collaboration and the physicists affiliated to other collaborations which utilize similar PMTs in the community of dark matter direct detection
